-------------------------------------    -------------------------

1) Ray tracing triangles                  Yes	

According to the assigment page, I compute the normals by calculate the two vectors of the triangle's slides, then, use this normal to compute the d,(in the equation: n*p0+d/(n*ray))then, compue the t, 
t = -(dot(cameraPos,normal)+d)/(dot(normal,ray));if t >0, then check to see the intersection points from camera is inside or not (use barycentric coordinates), if yes, then plot pixel according to the Phong Shading and Shadow
2) Ray tracing sphere                     Yes

Similiar with triangles, sphere instead uses different ways to calculate t, (t = b^2-4*c)
3) Triangle Phong Shading                 Yes
Take the normal from the given file, then, use it to compute the reflections, then use the phong shding equation to compute the I for each color channel (combine diffuse, specular, shiness at each vertex)
4) Sphere Phong Shading                   Yes

Similar with Triangle Pong Shading, but instead, only need to calculate diffuse, specular, and shiness once since one sphere is has the same diffuse, specular and shiness
5) Shadows rays                           Yes

Before apply the phong shading color to the image, the shadow ray is needed to compute the shadow, to set the color to (0,0,0) if the shadow is passing through any object on the way to the light position
6) Still images                           Yes
   

001.jpg -> screenfile.txt->Basic test scene with a triangle, ground plane and sphere:
002.jpg -> screenfile6.txt->SIGGPRAH, doesn't look well though.
003.jpg-> screenfile3.txt ->an image with transparent bottom where intersect with triangles (generated by set the boolean "extra" to true)
005.jpg->screenfile4.txt-> five spheres, looks good (generated by set the boolean "extra" to true)
006.jpeg->screenfile4.txt-> output when debuging the code, don't know what effect it is, but it looks good, so I saved it, right now, I can't generate it one more time.
7) Extra Credit (up to 20 points)
   
  Flip the global boolean extra to true and see the extra effect on those screenfiles
  (transparent bottom where intersect with ground)
